# Janus Pattern Library

A design system for creating Janus mocks — no Figma access needed. Synced from the **Horizon 2.0 ALPHA** Figma design system.

## How to create a mock

1. Open Claude Code
2. Paste your PRD
3. Add: **"refer to https://github.com/abhitsian/janus-pattern-library for the design system"**

That's it. Claude generates a `.html` file you can open in any browser.
